### **Proposed priority of sweep response actions**

1.  Solidarity defense following direction of people affected.  
    *   Only use direct action at the camp with the direction of camp residents.  
        
    *   Avoid arrests - these reflect poorly on the camp.  
        
    *   Have "Housing Not Sweeps" signs every time (maybe have a station setup next to banner with water, rights resources, moving resources, etc).  
        
    *   Document police abuse, property destruction, and other lawsuit violations.  
        
2.  Help people move who want to move and want help moving.  
    *   Move belongings outside tape so helpers can load their vehicles.  
        
    *   Log any locations people are moved to or where people say they are moving to.  
        
3.  Capture voices  
    *   Document voices of those directly affected.  
        
    *   Share voices of affected people with council, mayor, and publc every time.  
        
4.  Salvage items from trash piles before the trash trucks collect them. This limits how many things need to be replaced each sweep. Especially look for:  
    *   tents  
        
    *   sleeping bags  
        
    *   blankets  
        
    *   jackets  
        
    *   shoes  
        
    *   clothes  
        

### **Optional actions for between sweeps**  

Actions targeting city council and mayor  

Fuck the fences  

Blockade public works at their site.  

Create infographics comparing the costs of sweeps to proposed costs under a Housing First model.  

Solicit new moving locations from churches, private owners, inactive entertainment parking lots (e.g. bowling alley).  

Neighborhood outreach: tell people what is going on and invite them to sweeps.

*   People who live nearby
*   Pastors, rabbis, and other religious leaders
*   First responders
*   Nearby businesses
*   City councilmembers
