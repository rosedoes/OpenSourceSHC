Notes, thoughts:

1.  Source from CSAs and other bulk foods. Food discard piles from Whole Foods, small businesses, etc?

1.  Larger or more well-known camps receive food distribution at an unknown frequency, some of which is hot.

### **Community Meet & Greet - inactive**  

This was initially proposed by a member of the community.

Zoom awareness & fundraising event

*   Intro describing our goals

*   Panel of unhoused folks

*   Housed folks have a mediated opportunity to express their needs an concerns. Maybe these responses are tallied rather than immediately addressed; many people who are "anti-"homeless probably have shared concerns.
