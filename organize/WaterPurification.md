# WHAT IS THIS?

An option to turn the river into a source for drinking water  
using a 5 gallon bottle and water purification tablets (chlorine dioxide).  

# WHAT DOES IT DO?  

Chlorine dioxide tablets purify water so that it is safe for drinking.

It is effective against bacteria and viruses, including giardia and crypto,

**if you give it enough time to sit**.

# HOW DO I USE IT?  

1 tablet purifies 1 liter of unclean water

There are about 4 liters in 1 gallon, and there are 19 liters in 5 gallons. So:  

4 tablets purifies a 1 gallon bottle of water  

and  

19 tablets purifies a 5 gallon bottle of water  

**Only collect water if you have enough tablets to purify it**.  

  

1.  Fill the bottle with water from upstream.  
      
    
2.  Add the correct number of chlorine dioxide tablets for the amount of water.  
    (If your bottle has 1-gallon markings, add 4 tablets per line marking.)  
      
    
3.  Let it sit for 4 hours.  
    This is very important. If you don’t wait the full time before drinking the water, the chlorine dioxide may not have removed everything.
