This document is for planning, brainstorming, and designing sustainability efforts relating to drinking water distribution.  

# Specific camp plans

## **Water Tank @ Arkins - inactive**

## **Water Station @ Small Camps** **- inactive**  

We are working on a pilot program to give folks more water at the small-to-medium camps. The idea is 5 gallon bottles fitted with a spigot.

The stand provides:

*   easily noticeable community water station

*   elevated off the ground for improved accessibility

*   wheels to aid in refilling (the goal is for residents to be able to handle refilling)

*   covered shelter to help keep water cool in the sun

PLEASE COMMENT! THE ABOVE IS NOT SET IN STONE!!  

## **Large-scale River Water Purification -** **inactive; get in touch to help!**  

Update: Tablets are not enough. A better option is water filters.

*   4x 55 gallon drums  
    *   screen for physical contaminants  
        
    *   spigot/hose for easy dispensing  
        
    *   on wheels  
        
    *   mark every 5 gallons (for easy measuring)  
        
*   Water purification tablets - chlorine dioxide  
    
*   Permanent instructions on each drum  
    *   Dry-erase sticker: LAST PURIFIED: \_\_\_\_  
        
    *   Dangling dry-erase marker  
        
    *   [Water purification instructions](/WaterPurification.md)
        
    *   print, laminate/protect, and tape to each drum
	
#   Creative and miscellaneous ideas

*   If the city will provide hose access, an **inline water filter** like the Camco 40043 TastePure ($18) can be used to filter clean drinking water on an as-needed basis. The filter needs to be replaced at intervals.

*   Multiple placed **one-gallon gravity filter bladders** like the Sawyer SP160 ($40) can provide clean drinking water if folks otherwise have a source for non-drinking water to refill as needed (rain water, sink water, soap handwashing stations). The bladder hose needs to drain into a clean-water reservoir, I believe.

*   **DIY water filter** alternatives are cheaper-per-gallon and can increase water capacity to 5+ gallons.
*   [Public Toilet Advocacy Toolkit](https://toolkit.phlush.org/) from PHLUSH. “Our website serves as a practical knowledge base for urban restrooms design, ecological sanitation and emergency toilet systems.”
*   [Green Flush Restrooms](https://greenflushrestrooms.com/restrooms-for-the-homeless) makes prefabricated restrooms that don’t require utilities. They are sympathetic to the cause of public toilets.
*   [Lava Mae](https://lavamaex.org/build-your-program) partners with folks and has a toolkit to provide **mobile showers**.
    *   These folks listed themselves as having an interest in Lava Mae in Denver.
