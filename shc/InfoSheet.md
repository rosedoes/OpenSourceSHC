This document contains information about the structure and activities of Self Health Colorado. It may be of interest to people interested in getting involved with the collective. This network is growing and organizers are trying to keep up. **Ask questions and make suggestions.**  

## Vetting  

Interested volunteers may join a water distribution run as a form of in-person vetting. Afterward, you will receive a summary of the experience and a specific call-to-action telling you how to get more involved.  

## What is SHC?  

**WHO** | Self Health CO (SHC)/Clitter Belle; a network of individuals from around the Front Range with a variety of specialties and interests applicable to directly supporting the interests of houseless folks.

  

**WHAT** | Provide direct support as guided by the specific and requested needs of the folks we purport to serve. This comes in many forms: assessing needs, distributing water and supplies, showing up for sweeps(!), protesting, contacting representatives, fundraising, fulfilling item requests...

  

**Current goals**  

*   Water

*   Hygiene (toilets, showers, handwashing)

*   Sweep support

*   Support the general and specific interests of unhoused people in Denver

**WHERE** | Encampments, especially for On-the-Ground (OTG) and Sweep folks. When we see or hear of another place where multiple folks are staying, we try to add it to our network. These places are often targets for sweeps, which is when the City (enforced by police) makes everyone move their tent and belongings while the area is cleaned by public workers. Folks don't like sweeps.  

## Areas of Involvement  

**On-the-ground (OTG)**: Primarily water distribution, plus trash bags if available. We try to do this daily to a specific set of camps. This is also outreach because we can offer folks an opportunity to share any needs or concerns. We also take note of any new camps we see or hear about so we can (hopefully) add them to the route.

  

**Overview of program ideas**  

1.  Water Distribution  
    
2.  Clothing Library & Distribution  
    
3.  Enrichment Program  
    
4.  Hot Food Program  
    
5.  Spa Services Program  
    

**Sweep Day OTG**: This is not a group, but a lot more people come out on days when a sweep is planned. Water, snacks, recording/documenting, sign holding, general sweep protesting...as applies to one's interests. Sweep days are tough to feel useful, lots of standing and watching, but the numbers are SO important!!  

  

**Internal/Planning** (funds and fundraising, obtaining supplies and requested resources, diy crafting, business outreach) All skills are valued! More info can be provided on anything you want to get involved with.  

## Personal and Group Security  

Our rule-of-thumb for security is: choose the level of security that the most anxious person inthe group is comfortable with. That said, there are some steps everyone is encouraged to take not just for our anticapitalist activities, but for our personal activities as well:

  

Virtual Private Network (VPN)

*   VPNs hide your Internet activity from your Internet provider and others who would do you no good. A simplified example: If you sent your browsing history in the mail to Comcast, the VPN would fudge the return address and wipe off the fingerprints.  
    

Encrypted communication

*   We use Signal as a text messaging app. We try to break up into "silos," or groups with a shared or relatively narrow focus. The Water OTG group has its own chat, for example.

*   Groups may have time limits on how long a message is visible before it disappears; this time limit can be changed at any time by anybody and is useful for "pinning" important messages in time-limited chats.

*   Any group may have a liason in another group if those groups work closely (fundraising + OTG, for example). Individuals can also be messaged directly through Signal by tapping their user image and tapping the message bubble icon.  
    

Encrypted collaboration

*   This is a sore area. The documents are currently largely unusable due to their inaccessibility. We are using three tools for encrypted collaboration:

*   Rise Up Pads, this site, for most of our document processing. It offers only the simplest editing tools, but it is safe from prying eyes and meets _most_ of our needs.

*   Ethercalc is a spreadsheet used for the OTG log.

*   CryptPads is used for just one document, the Supply List, because Rise Up Pads does not support tables. CryptPads is not really usable on Android phones in Chrome, at least. It is otherwise an all-around good tool for us. We switched to other services due to that issue.

*   We are looking for a viable alternative to this ridiculousness  
    

## Thoughts and ideas  

### **Agile**  

When discussing and planning group action items or goal lists, could agile/scrum methodology be useful?

1.  Agile is designed for small teams.  
    
2.  Under agile, teams break their work into goals that can be completed within timelimited iterations.  
    
3.  Teams track progress and set daily goals in daily 15-minute meetings.  
    

### **SHC mission, values**  

SHC promotes health & hygiene autonomy through  

1.  education  
    
2.  providing physical resources  
    
3.  connecting individuals to resources
