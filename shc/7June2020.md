### **How do we bring in new folks?**  

\- Ideally committees each come up with their own processes to meet different needs  

1.  There is something for ANYBODY  
    
2.  Folks can be paired as needed  
    

\- What are our group security needs?  

1.  Siloing is key for plausible deniability  
    
2.  There should be a baseline security level  
    1.  BEST: 2+ trusted people who can vet potentially new people  
        
    2.  Request social media/phone number if nobody knows a potentially new person  
        
    3.  Share some info so that everyone has a chance to veto the potentially new person  
        
    4.  OR keep 1-1 convo and only vet when 1-1 becomes annoying  
        

\- Individual committees should have their own comfort level  

\- Who's doing the vetting? Who's bringing folks in?  

1.  Much of the vetting and recruitment has been on [redacted], who gets a read in person but cannot currently leave the house. They are relying on the introducers vetting, if any.  
    
2.  Folks should be interacting in person before being added to any chats, at least for OTG.  
    

Recruitment options

1.  Denver Food Not Bombs are all cyclists  
    
2.  Mutual Aid Denver provides hygiene services  
    
3.  DHOL has space where we can perhaps store water - [redacted] will connect
