This pad was created to compile notes on security. Security notes from meeting minutes are moved to this document.  

Learned Lesson: In case of sticky situations, consult the group for how to proceed.  

  
There is a stated need for technology education for organizers and activists. This can take the form of:

*   Zoom classes (group or one-on-one)

*   slides

*   recorded presentation

*   written mannual/descriptions  
    

### **Established Recommendations**  

1.  Security benchmark should satisfy the most concerned person in a group.  
    
2.  Silo conversations so that groups only "know" about what's relevant to that group (e.g. no camp locations in non-drop threads, no sweep planning in non-sweep chats). There are different groups to hide information from:  
    1.  servers/website owners (e.g. Google)  
        
    2.  Internet Service Providers (ISP) (e.g. Comcast)  
        
    3.  nefarious individuals (e.g. hackers, Nazis)  
        
    4.  local police  
        
3.  It is highly recommended that you use a VPN when connected to the Internet on your computer and mobile devices. Choose a VPN that does not log any data.  
    
4.  Do not use Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc to communicate about SHC-related and -adjacent activities  
    
5.  Get a burner phone only if you _want_ the added security of having a disposable, additional, or untraceable number. It is not required.

### **Thoughts and ideas, not established**  

1.  Create a group for a Core Strategy Team who are more involved  
    
2.  Create a general thread to grow membership/involvement  
    
3.  Disclosing personal identities? Do we need nicknames? – waiting on more info from Clitter's connections  
    
4.  There should be a buddy system for new OTG volunteers where they receive training on boundary setting as it applies to OTG work  
    

### **Software requirements and options**  

\- password manager (storage & creation of secure passwords)  

*   LastPass - free, has official mobile app

*   KeePass - open source, has user-contributed mobile apps

\- VPN that does not collect logs/data (encrypts Internet browsing activity)  

*   RiseUp has an open source VPN for computer and mobile: [https://riseup.net/en/vpn](https://riseup.net/en/vpn)

*   PrivateInternetAccess is $40/year [https://www.privateinternetaccess.com](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com)

\- encrypted email (hides email data from server/website owner)  

*   ProtonMail is widely in use

*   BitMessage hides "non-content" data like sender and receiver [https://wiki.bitmessage.org//](https://wiki.bitmessage.org//)

*   Important: encrypted-to-encrypted is secure. encrypted-to-not-encrypted is not secure.

*   TIP: Clear the email body before typing a reply to avoid logs of the full thread

\- encrypted chats  

*   use more timers/disappearing messages

*   Signal Profile > Privacy > Block screenshots to avoid chats being shared

*   alternatives to Signal that is not tied to phone #/does not share # with participants

*   TorChat (seems to not be maintained) [https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads](https://github.com/prof7bit/TorChat/downloads)  
    
*   burner # (e.g. TextNow)  
  
*   other fake or "in between" #  
    

encrypted video (hide participants, audio recordings, and text chats from server)

*   Jitsi
*   BlueJeans
    

### How to secure membership  

Learn from the infiltration of Rent Strike Facebook group  

*   what questions could aid in vetting/screening?

*   offer information only during time-limited meetings or events (disappearing info)

*   security is more important than numbers
